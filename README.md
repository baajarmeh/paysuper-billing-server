## Getting Started

Billing Server is designed to be cloud agnostic application. In general we use Kubernetes based installation to launch PaySuper in a dev environment cloud and AWS for production.

### Architecture

![Schema of the architecture](docs/schema.png)

## Developing

### Branches

We use the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) as a branching model for Git.

### Docker deployment

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t paysuper_billing_service

docker run -d -e "MONGO_DSN=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/billing_repository" -e "CACHE_PROJECT_PAYMENT_METHOD_TIMEOUT=600" paysuper_billing_service
```

### Starting the application

Billing Server application can be started in 2 modes:

* as microservice, to maintain rates requests from other components of system. This mode does not requests any rates
* as console app, to run the tasks, that passed as command line argument

Console mode can be used with cron schedule.

To start app in console mode you must set `-task` flag in command line to one of these values:

- `vat_reports` - to update vat reports data. This task must be run every day, at the end of day.
- `royalty_reports` - to build royalty reports for merchants. This task must be run once on a week.
- `royalty_reports_accept` - to auto-accept toyalty reports. This task must be run daily.
- `rebuild_accounting_entries` - to rebuild accounting entries and order view for passed orderid. Full command looks like, 
for example, `-task=rebuild_accounting_entries -orderid=5f0d19a5eb851d9ee7935ffa -force=true` where -orderid is id of order, 
and -force is flag to delete old accounting entries (if exists) and create new ones. 

Notice: for `vat-reports` task you may pass an report date (from past only!) for that you need get an report. 
Date passed as `date` parameter, in YYYY-MM-DD format 

Example: `$ paysuper-billing-server.exe -task=vat_reports -date="2018-12-31"` runs VAT reports calculation for 
last day of December, 2018.

To run application as microservice simply don't pass any flags to command line :)
